TOP project to learn useEffect to fetch and use data.

This memory card game renders pokemon cards for the user to click.
The objective is to click as many unique pokemon as possible without clicking a duplicate.

----going forward ----
make game resetable at win/lose screen
(possibly combine win and lose screen? probably would be a simple ternary)

create lose screen and have it pop up when user loses.

could add a transition animation in the shuffle effect
