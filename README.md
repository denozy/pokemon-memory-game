TOP project to learn useEffect to fetch and use data.

This memory card game renders pokemon cards for the user to click.
The objective is to click as many unique pokemon as possible without clicking a duplicate.

----going forward ----
could still go with a ? in the top right corner for the rules explanation.

update win/loss screen to just look a little nicer. Could also create assets of happy and sad pokemon gifs to display on win/loss for extra touch.

pokemon sprites in header change on shuffle still for some reason. currently use useRef to try and make a static copy of pokemon when fetched but still shuffles.

add a transition animation when cards are initially displayed and shuffled.

adjust styling for different screen sizes - when squished, the pokemon cards overflow in a really ugly way, instead of pushing the header and footer up.

---optional----mainly add to show skills
add music
add sound effects for clicks
create neat drop down modal for rules or something.
